# dictionary

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT
This is a dictionary app desinged to integrate Jisho's API. 
As an example, https://jisho.org/api/v1/search/words?keyword=house returns the package stored in house.json. This provides an example of what might be returned when a user searches for a english word
https://jisho.org/api/v1/search/words?keyword=漢字 returns the package stored in 漢字.json. This provides and example of what might be returned when a user searches for a japanese word.
https://jisho.org/api/v1/search/words?keyword=私は駅に行きます returns the package stored in 私は駅に行きます.json. This provides an example of what might be returned when a user inputs a whole japanese phrase.
This dictionary needs to provide a user frendly interface to search words (english, kanji, whatever else), parse the package, and dislay the information in a user friendly format. 
It needs functionality so I can add words to lists, and provide flashcard study options with spaced review.
It should provide links to other relvant information returned in the packages, for further study
Implement any other features that would be pertinant to a well performing, useful, japanese app.
